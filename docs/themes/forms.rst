Customizing Forms
#################

To provide custom Form field templates or to manipulate the Form body, create the following directory structure::

    Field/ <– for customizing form field types
    html/
        MauticFormBundle/
            Builder/
                _style.html.twig  <– for customizing CSS for Form
        form.html.twig <– for customizing the form structure itself

Copy from ``app/bundles/FormBundle/Resources/views/form.html.twig`` into the Theme’s Builder directory and/or one or more of the fields templates in ``app/bundles/FormBundle/Views/Field/*.html.php`` into the Theme’s `field` directory. Then customize to the desired layout.

You can add a custom style sheet to the Form by adding a ``_style.html.twig`` with your custom CSS to ``html/MauticFormBundle/Builder``. The best way is to copy the content of the default Form styles and modify them to your needs.

Customize field types
*********************

Create a new template in the `Field` directory to change HTML generated by field types.
The best way is to copy the original template from `app/bundles/FormBundle/Resources/views/Field/*.html.twig` and modify it.
